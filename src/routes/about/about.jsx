   <h1>Welcome to my Íô≥Little Íô≥ corner
   of the Internet ;)</h1>

   <p> I was a 14-year-old average guy who always thought that my friends were really good at least at something, while on the other hand, I was average in academics, sports, and all other activities. I was not perfect at anything, but that was before I knew how to code. <br /> <br />

I started my journey with basic HTML and CSS and coded my first website when I was 14. After that, I enjoyed coding so much that I spent more time on it than focusing on my academics. I chose PCM in 11th grade but didn‚Äôt study much. While my friends were preparing for JEE, I was sitting in my room, learning different web development languages and frameworks and building tons of projects. <br /> <br />

I also tried a lot of other skills like YouTube, where I got over 10 thousand subscribers by uploading UI design videos, and I also tried video editing on different software like Premiere Pro and CapCut. But nothing can beat VS Code and Figma for real. <br /> <br /></p>

    <h1>Fun facts about me</h1>
    <p>üòä I always wanted to be a youtuber and tried bunch of different niche like gaming, tech and now that I got 11 thousand subs on my channel, last video I uploaded was about an year ago :)</p>
  <p>üçµ When I‚Äôm not designing, you can find me watching Netflix, lifting weights, and looking for design inspirations.</p>
  <p>üå¥ I also love to play different sports mainly badminton, basketball, snooker and ofcourse Cricket (yeah avg. Indian guy)</p>
  <p>üçø I'm seriously addicted to web series, but I can give you some killer recommendations like HIMYM, Friends, and TVD. Trust me, you won't regret it. </p>
  <p>üéµ There's always something that people can't live without, right? For me, it's music. I'm really into Punjabi music (I'm Punjabi, lol) and, of course, Hindi romantic and classical hits (again typical Indian, haha). </p>
  <p>üíª I designed and developed this website from scratch, which I‚Äôm proud of.</p>
